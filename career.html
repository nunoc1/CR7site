    <h1> Cristiano Ronaldo Career</h1>
    <h2>Clubs</h2>

    Cristiano Ronaldo has had a wonderful career, winning numerous titles and playing for several great clubs.<br> 
    <h3>Sporting FC</h3>He started in Sporting FC, a portuguese popular club, There he displayed good gameplay and stood out, transferring to Man UTD.<img src="./"
    <h3>Man UTD</h3> 
    His peak began in England, where he won a Champions League and a Ballon d'Or. And after years he was bought by Real Madrid.
    <h3>Real Madrid</h3>
    At the Spanish club, Robozao, as he is known, experienced the peak of his career, winning numerous titles and scoring countless goals, one of the most remarkable periods in football history.
    <h3>Juventus</h3>
    The Portuguese player may not have reached his peak, but he had a good spell with the Italian team. Many people believe that was a bad part of his career, but it wasn't; he scored many goals and won titles.
    <h3>Man UTD</h3>
    Back in Manchester, even with an extremely limited team, Cristiano made his appearances, and although it was a more discreet spell, the striker managed to stand out.
    <h3>Al Nassr</h3>
    Today I play for Al Nassr, an Arab team. Ronaldo continues his quest for 1000 goals, and despite being 41 years old, he remains extremely competitive and in great shape.
